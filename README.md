This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: failure to handle errors during database queries within route handlers. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, where a database query's potential failure is not addressed. This can cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling, ensuring robustness and preventing unexpected application behavior.
